                As 1st year undergraduates we had to identify a problem that we see in our day today life for our
                Engineering Design, Principles, and Communication module. From the ancient times Sri Lanka is known as a
                country which has an agriculturally based economy. So we identified that many famers are suffering from
                crop depredation by birds.

            <br>
            <div>
                We collected data from
                <ul>
                    <li>in-field studies</li>
                    <li>referring journals</li>
                    <li>through web search</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                We specifically found out that birds do not prefer frequencies between 1 - 4 kHz and we made a device
                that is capable of emitting frequencies of that range. Through our device we can minimize the crop
                depredation by birds which will for all intents and purposes help farmers to maximize their profit.

            <br>
            <div>
                After going through a brief literature review related to this topic, we were able to identify the
                problem clearly and we clearly sorted out the needs, constraints and limitations related to our problem
                and solution. After that we identified our objectives, and we defined those objectives and stepped
                towards the objective tree and intended objective list.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                After making the specification lists and requirements we were able to develop user interaction activity
                list and functional decomposition diagrams while identifying the proposed sub functions and features and
                building up the connections between each sub functions. We used weighted rating evaluation method for
                those sub functions and sort out the best possible functions for our device.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                Then we went through the proposed conceptual designs by our team members and with the instructions of
                our instructor we got the best of all conceptual designs and made the design for the frequency emitter.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                Finally after proceeding with the steps of making bill of materials and cost estimations we generated a
                3D animation of our device as due to the Covid 19 pandemic we are unable to physically build up this
                device.

            <div>
                Used software,

                Special thank goes to our module lecturers Prof. Chandana Perera and Mr. Madhawa Herath. Also, our
                instructor Mr. Oshada Gamage, who always guided us in the right direction.
